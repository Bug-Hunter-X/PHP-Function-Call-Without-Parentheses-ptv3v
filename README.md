This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP: calling a function without parentheses. While it's a common typo, PHP's flexibility can lead to confusing results. The `bug.php` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.php` provides the corrected version. This is an uncommon error because PHP's loose syntax might not always immediately highlight the issue.
